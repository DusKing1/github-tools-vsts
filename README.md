## Debug

[vsts-task-lib](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-task-lib/blob/master/node/docs/vsts-task-lib.md) allow to pass properties running on development and debugging errors. The base script is `yarn dev:debug`, creating a connection with chrome devtools.

To it work properly, you first need to export options, for example:

```
export INPUT_GITHUBENDPOINT='EP'
export ENDPOINT_URL_EP='https://www.github.com/'
export ENDPOINT_AUTH_EP='{"parameters":{"accessToken":"*****"}}'
export INPUT_GITHUBREPOSITORY='owner/repository'
export INPUT_GITHUBTAG='v0.0.0'
export INPUT_GITHUBRELEASETITLE='v0.0.0'
export INPUT_GITHUBRELEASEDRAFT=True/False
export INPUT_GITHUBRELEASEASSET='xxxx\**\*.png'
export INPUT_MANIFESTJSON='xxxx\manifest.json'
```

Then `yarn dev:debug`

## Why?
I was disappointed with all the current GitHub extensions tools solutions. Most of them don't have most of the options GitHub can provide and don't are maintained anymore. So, I found [publish-release](https://github.com/remixz/publish-release) repository with almost every option that I need, helped them to finish some issues and use that to create this extension for VSTS Releases and Builds.
